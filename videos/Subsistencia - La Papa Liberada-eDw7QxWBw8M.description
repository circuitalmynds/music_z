Nuestra Tierra Anahuac - 1996 XRF Xican@ Records & Films
Yes The Same Record Company As Aztlan Underground & NOT The Crust Band From Colombia That Play Under The Same Name.

Subsistencia Is A Band From Los Angeles, CA. That Arose From The Latino Hardcore Of The 1990's With Heavy Influences In The Anarcho-Punk Scene While Adding Indiginous Pre Hispanic Instruments, Melodies, And The Presence Of Male And Female Vocals This Is A Band That Can't Really Be Classified Into One Specific Genre. 
Their Message Shouldn't Be Hard To Catch. The Educational Awarness Of The Indigenous Peoples And Latino Community On The American Continent As A Whole Suffering With Social Degredation, Political Oppression And Economic Exploitation. Feminismo. Zapatismo. Cultural Understanding, Spirituality, Repsect For All Beings, And United Personal Revolution..
Though This Is Their Only Full Length Album There Are Other Releases & Subsistencia Still Perfom As A Unit To This Day But Sadly Without Lina Who Now Resides In Mexico... 
If You Like This You Should Also Check Out The Band TRAGATELO That Operated From 1999 - 2002 With Lina On Vocals And Members Of Life's Halt & Los Crudos.
