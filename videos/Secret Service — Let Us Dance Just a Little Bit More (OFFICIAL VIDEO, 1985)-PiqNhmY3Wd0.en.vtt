00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:34.065
Night is gone

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.700
Now we’re alone

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.020
I feel your body near mine

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.780
We just have to dance one more time

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.900
You´re closer now

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.200
I can’t deny

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.800
This feeling with you, is it fate?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.340
I don’t care if the hour is late

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.900
at all

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.480
Let us dance just a little bit more

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.920
Even if the band walks out the door

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.880
And all the others gone

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.900
Let’s pretend that the music’s on

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.000
Even if we’re dancing all alone

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.400
And the night is gone

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.580
Just for a while

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.720
I saw your smile

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.620
I know I’ve sang in your ear

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.820
«God, it’s good to be near»

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.460
Your hand in mine

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.000
So warm and fine

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.040
If only this moment would stay

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.720
If only the band was to play

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.100
some more

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.360
Let us dance just a little bit more

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.540
Even if the band walks out the door

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.900
And all the others go

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.900
Let’s pretend that the music’s on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.900
Even if we’re dancing all alone

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.080
And the night is gone

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.800
Let us dance just a little bit more

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.660
Even when the band walks out the door

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.940
And all the others go

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.880
Let’s pretend that the music’s on

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.960
Even if we’re dancing all alone

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.400
And the night is gone
